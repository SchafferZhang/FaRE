# Open Source Face Recognition Performance Evaluation Package (FaRE)

FaRE is a *light-weight*, *maintainable*, *scalable*, *generalizable*, and *extendable* face recognition evaluation toolbox. It supports both online and offline evaluation to provide feedback to algorithm development and accelerate biometric-related research.
It consists of a set of evaluation metric functions and provides various APIs for commonly used face recognition datasets including LFW, CFP, UHDB31, and IJB datasets, which can be easily extended to include other customized datasets. 

The code will be released after obtaining the approval from the University of Houston.
